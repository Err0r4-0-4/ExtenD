## Problem it solves
- Our website acts as a channel between the creators on various social media platforms and their followers
- Any user can see the list of their favorite creators and can tip some money in crypto(eth)
- Also a user can look up for official merchs that are available for thier favorite creator and buy from them to show their love and support
- Now on the creator side a creator can create their own profile and receive their tips into their ethereum wallet and can also and sell their merchs 
- The merchs that they want to sell can be added by the creator on thier profile
- We also have a feature that helps creators to manage their sponsorship deals with companies. Here the creator can upload the copy of written agreement  between him/her and the company. The agreement file is further uploaded to ipfs servers and a hash a returned. The creator can always view the list and details of the agreements that he/she has signed so far
- Now to make sure that the agreement is not tampered by any of the party the two hashes (one on blockchain and second one on ipfs server are matched), and if they are same it ensures that agreement stored on server is not tampered
- The user and the creator can both check their transaction histories that they made through their wallet for example the user can see when and how much he has spent on tips and buying merchs and the creator can see when and from where he received ethers
